# Security Fixes Applied to Database Schema

## Issue: Function Search Path Mutable

### Problem
Supabase's database linter detected that several functions had mutable search paths, which is a security vulnerability. Functions without explicit search paths can be exploited through search path manipulation attacks.

### Functions Fixed
1. `public.update_updated_at_column`
2. `public.handle_new_user`
3. `public.award_feedback_points`

### Solution Applied
Added `SET search_path = public` to all function definitions to explicitly set the search path and prevent security vulnerabilities.

### Before (Vulnerable):
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- function body
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### After (Secure):
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER 
SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
    -- function body
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Prevents Search Path Attacks**: Explicitly setting the search path prevents malicious users from manipulating the function's behavior by altering the search path.

2. **Consistent Function Behavior**: Functions will always use the same schema resolution, making behavior predictable and secure.

3. **Compliance with Best Practices**: Follows Supabase and PostgreSQL security recommendations.

## Files Updated

1. `database/schema.sql` - Main schema file with security fixes
2. `database/migrations/add_user_types.sql` - Migration file with security fixes

## Verification

After running the updated schema, the Supabase linter should no longer show warnings for:
- `function_search_path_mutable` for any of the three functions

## Next Steps

1. Run the updated `database/schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. Verify that the linter warnings are resolved
3. Test the registration functionality to ensure everything works correctly

The security fixes maintain full functionality while eliminating the security vulnerabilities.
